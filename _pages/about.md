I am a third-year PhD student at EDF R&D and in [BONUS Team](https://sites.google.com/view/bonus-research-group/) at [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/) (University of Lille, Inria Nord Europe). I currently visit the [ARCHES](https://project.inria.fr/arches/) team from INRIA Paris.

I am supervised by [Pr. Claire Monteleoni](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/claire-monteleoni/),  [Pr. El-Ghazali Talbi](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/~talbi/) and [Margaux Brégère](https://margauxbregere.github.io/).

My research focuses on automated deep learning for temporal and spatiotemporal forecasting, in particular for energy-related topics. I developped a first python package called [DRAGON](https://dragon-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to optimize deep neural networks. The code is available on my github. If you want to test it, do not hesite to get in touch with me!
