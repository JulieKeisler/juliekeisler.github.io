I am a second-year PhD student at EDF R&D and in [BONUS Team](https://sites.google.com/view/bonus-research-group/) at [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/) (University of Lille, Inria Nord Europe).

I am supervised by [El-Ghazali Talbi](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/~talbi/) professor at Polytech'Lille - University of Lille, [Margaux Brégère](https://margauxbregere.github.io/), Sandra Claudel and Gilles Cabriel from EDF. I currently visit the [ARCHES Team](https://project.inria.fr/arches/) from INRIA Paris.

My research focuses on automated deep learning for temporal and spatiotemporal forecasting, in particular for energy-related topics. I developped a first python package called [DRAGON](https://dragon-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to optimize deep neural networks. The code is available on my github. If you want to test it, do not hesite to get in touch with me!
