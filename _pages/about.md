I am currently a researcher in the [ARCHES](https://project.inria.fr/arches/) team from INRIA Paris. My research focuses on AI-driven methods for statistical downscaling. However, I am also interested in automated machine learning, particularly neural architecture search, and the use of AI methods for the energy transition in general.

I completed my PhD in January 2025 under the supervision of [Claire Monteleoni](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/claire-monteleoni/) (INRIA Paris and the University of Colorado Boulder),  [El-Ghazali Talbi](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/~talbi/) (INRIA Lille and Université de Lille), [Margaux Brégère](https://margauxbregere.github.io/) (EDF R&D and Sorbonne Université), Gilles Cabriel and Sandra Claudel. The thesis is entitled *Automated Deep Learning: algorithms and software for energy sustainability*. The manuscript will is available [*here*](https://theses.fr/2025ULILB001), the defense can be watched [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/live/nxmE5_rMVeA?si=vsd899L1BWkxX3VK) and the slides found [*here*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3qLndtOVZD9qvkz0i1A-dbqDRx-FR8_/view?usp=drive_link).

I developed a Python package called [DRAGON](https://dragon-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to optimise deep neural networks and, more recently, generalised additive models. The code is available on my GitHub. If you would like to test it, please get in touch!
