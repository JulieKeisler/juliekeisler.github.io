I am a second-year PhD student at EDF R&D and in [BONUS Team](https://sites.google.com/view/bonus-research-group/) at [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/) (University of Lille, Inria Nord Europe).

I am supervised by [El-Ghazali Talbi](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/~talbi/) professor at Polytech'Lille - University of Lille, Sandra Claudel and Gilles Cabriel from EDF.

My research focuses on automated deep learning for temporal and spatiotemporal forecasting, in particular for energy-related topics.
